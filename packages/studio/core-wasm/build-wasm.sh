#  - engine.wasm        the dynamic-linker host. Imports the linear memory (--import-memory) AND the

#                       `process` into it and the engine calls them via call_indirect. Exports device_alloc
#                       / device_register for the worklet loader.
#  - device_*.wasm      PIC SIDE MODULES (-C relocation-model=pic, --experimental-pic -shared): each one's
#                       data base is assigned by the host loader at load (env.__memory_base), so any number
#                       of distinct devices coexist in the one memory with no fixed --global-base.
#                       Same memory import as the engine.

# NON-shared linear memory: the worklet/worker that runs the engine creates and owns it, nothing outside
# reads the heap. Without the shared flag the runtime may relocate the buffer on grow, so no upfront
# address-space reservation (the constrained-device boot failures, #1030). --no-check-features skips
# wasm-ld's feature lint on precompiled core and the deps. Stays on stable, no build-std.
SHARED="-C link-arg=--no-check-features"
# PIC side module: data/table placed relative to host-assigned __memory_base / __table_base (dynamic
# linking). relocation-model=pic must reach EVERY object linked into the -shared module: the deps
# (libm/dsp, via RUSTFLAGS) AND core itself, which is precompiled non-PIC, so we rebuild it PIC with
# -Zbuild-std (nightly only). The engine + sine stay on stable; only the devices need nightly.
#  - panic=immediate-abort + default-visibility=hidden are ESSENTIAL: without them, -shared exports all of
#    core and --gc-sections cannot prune it -> a ~1158-function module needing 58 GOT entries (a full
#    dynamic linker to resolve). With them, only process/init/state_size are roots, core is pruned, and the
#    module is ~2 KB with NO GOT, so the worklet loader needs no GOT resolution.
# WASM SIMD128 (fixed-width 128-bit vectors): supported in every current browser + Node. A pure codegen
# feature: LLVM auto-vectorizes without changing IEEE semantics (no reassociation without fast-math), so
# the TS-vs-WASM parity holds bit-for-bit. Must reach the DEPS too (dsp/engine-env hold the hot loops),
# hence RUSTFLAGS on the engine build, not just `cargo rustc --` (which only flags the final crate).
